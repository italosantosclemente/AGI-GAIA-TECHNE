# Philosophical Mappings in v7.0

## 1. Auseinandersetzung ↔ Parallel Inference-time Reasoning
Intelligence emerges from multi-agent cognitive conflict. v7.0 models this as agents on a directed graph maintaining productive tension.

## 2. Firewall Ontológico ↔ Aletheia Natural Language Verifier
The ontological boundary is managed by the Verifier subagent, applying Kantian universalizability tests to prevent "specification gaming" (transcendental illusions).

## 3. Bedeutungsfunktion ↔ Structural Invariance
Meaning is constituted through pure structural relations. v7.0 implements this by extracting graph isomorphism classes from proof structures.

## 4. Mythos-Logos-Ethos ↔ Multimodal Native Reasoning
Mythical thought (pattern/neural), logical thought (symbolic), and ethical thought (normative) all interact through the intersubjectivity graph.

## 5. Aufhebung vs Auseinandersetzung ↔ Speculative vs Critical AGI
v7.0 allows a configurable choice between convergence (Aufhebung) and pluralism (Auseinandersetzung).
